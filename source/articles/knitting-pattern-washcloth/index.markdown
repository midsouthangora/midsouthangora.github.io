## **Knitting Pattern **- Bobble Washcloth




![basket](../../images/basket.jpg)









I used Bernat Handicrafter worsted weight cotton yarn and size 8            needles. I slip the first stitch of every row purl wise and knit through the back loop of the last stitch of every row to make the garter stitch edging look nicer.







Cast on 40 stitches. Knit for 7 rows of garter stitch.

**Bobble Pattern: **

Row 1: (Right Side) K5, Purl until end, end K5.

Row 2: K5, *(K1, P1, K1) in next stitch, P3 tog*, repeat between 's. end K5.

Row 3: KS, P until end, end K5.             
Row 4: K5. *P3 tog, (K1, P1, K1) in next stitch,* repeat between .'s, end K5.

Repeat these 4 rows for pattern. Continue until piece measures 9 inches from beginning or             until desired length.

Endwith 7 rows of garter stitch. Bind off and weave in ends.
