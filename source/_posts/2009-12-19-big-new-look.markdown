We rolled out our new web site today. We plan to add a lot of new features shortly to make it a fun stay here at Mid-South.

It is also time to renew Mid-South membership. You can conveniently renew or join here on the web site. Just click on the icon in the right column of the site and it will take you right to PayPal. Just fill out the short form and you can pay with PayPal or a credit card. A very quick and simple form, along with totally secure transaction. Come join us!

The latest on the NARBC Nationals will be posted in a day or two so keep a look out for that. We hope you are planning to attend the Nationals in March 2010!

We will have an on line show entry form available for the Nationals and the Angora specialty show for your entry convenience. There will be a Mid-South raffle table so please donate any extra things you have laying around. You can send them to Sarah Schumate or Kim Gay. You may also bring them with you to the show with you.
