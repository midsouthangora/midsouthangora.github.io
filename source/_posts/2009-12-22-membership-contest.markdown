We are having a **membership contest.** We will have a first, second, and third prizes to be awarded. The contest will run from now - Dec. 22 to Feb. 30th. Prizes will be awarded at the Dalton show in March or mailed. There are only a few rules so have fun! I will try to keep a running count if I can keep up with Jacque! LOL


### First Prize - A beautiful angora bunny donated by Amanda Politino. (bunny of her choosing) The prize bunny will be delivered to the Dalton show in March. If you will not be attending or can not get someone to pick it up for you an alternative prize of Mixed Fiber will be awarded.




### Second Prize - 8 oz. of Angora fiber




### Third Prize - A very nice slicker brush


We will not have to many rules here. If you are not a current member you still may participate in the contest. All you will be required to do is join first, then start getting members. Please be sure that when you send someone to join that you remind them to mention your name or we can't give you credit. :) There is a place in the cart for a referral name.

_Rules - To receive a prize, the minimum of 3 people will have to be referred and join._

Have fun and hope to see everyone at Dalton this year!![basket](http://www.midsouthangora.com/angora/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/basket1-100x100.jpg)
