    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well we are getting close to the Dalton, Ga. shows now. I have checked with those in charge of the trophies for the NARBC Nationals and our Mid-South Angora Specialty show and all the trophies are ready! Yippee! Keep your fingers crossed that things go well for us. Everyone has worked hard hopefully it will be a smooth ride.</p>

<p>I have talked to several people from far off who are planning on coming to the show. This is a great chance to get new stock that would otherwise be out of our reach to get other than shipping! The Nationals will probably not be around here again for some time so do take advantage of this one close by us!</p>

<p>If you have items for the raffle table please bring them with you. It looks like we will have a fantastic raffle this year thanks to all our hard working members. There will be a wide range of very nice things so please plan to participate in that.</p>

<p>All in all I think we will have a great time. If my dvd recorder works this year I plan on getting videos of the shows. They will be available just as soon as I get back and get them uploaded to the web site. If you would like to purchase a video let me know. Terri Greathouse will be our photographer again this year. We should have some great pictures for viewing also.</p>

<p>More later&hellip;&hellip;</p>
